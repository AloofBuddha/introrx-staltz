# introrx-staltz
The intro to RxJS project from https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754

## Core Functionality (proposed)
* On startup, load accounts data from the API and display 3 suggestions
* On clicking "Refresh", load 3 other account suggestions into the 3 rows
* On click 'x' button on an account row, clear only that current account and display another
* Each row displays the account's avatar and links to their page
